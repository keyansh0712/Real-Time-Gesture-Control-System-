# Real-Time-Gesture-Control-System-
## Overview
This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using a webcam and performing specific actions based on the detected gestures. The primary objective is to detect a specific hand gesture (e.g., a gesture with three or more defects between fingers) and execute a predefined action (e.g., pressing the 'space' key) using the pyautogui library.
